# Task Description

**A Sound equalizer is a basic tool in the music industry. It also serves in several biomedical applications like hearing aid industry.**

- The two signal viewers display the signal “before” and “after” the equalization actions. <br>
 **Note**  the two viewers are  exactly linked. i.e. they  always show the same exact part of the signal when the user scroll or zoom on any one of them.

- The equalizer panel contain 10 sliders, each control the gain of 1/10 of the bandwidth of the frequency domain. The default value of each slider is 1 (i.e. the corresponding BW of the signal remain as is) and can go up to 5 and drop down to 0.
- Upon changing any equalizing slider, two things change:
    1. The signal itself  change in the “After” viewer.
    2. The spectrogram is also  updated to reflect the change.
- Software can open a music file, play it, then be able to save the output in a new sound file that can played in other players.
- The user can compare the results (through graphs saved in pdf format or by listening to the after signal)
